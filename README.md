FreeBASIC stdlib
======

FreeBASIC does not have a real stdlib, hence writting good code was nearly
impossible without a decent set of pre-implemented methods.

The goal of this project was to provide as much functionality in form
of a pseudo-stdlib, which could be used by my other personal projects later.

Unfortunately the code is overall not really good, but it is partially being
used by Snowmanrun-Online (https://github.com/domso/smro).
